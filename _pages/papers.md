## High School
 * May 2021: [An Introductory Exploration of Diophantine Equations](/files/IntroductoryExplorationDiophantineEquations.pdf). This paper served as my IB Math HL Internal Assessment. This was the first time I used LaTeX!
 * October 2020: [Buffon's Needle](/files/Buffon'sNeedleGoogleDoc.pdf). My IB extended essay. This was my first ever math paper, and yes, I wrote it in google docs.
