## Research Experience
* Gallery of Theorems, Spring 2024
  * Aim: Represent mathematics concepts using artistic mediums
  * Further developed Numberscope visualizer to increase functionality
  * Advisor: Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sarahpetersen/home">Sarah Peterson</a>

* Independent Study - Parameterizations of Descartes Quadruples, Fall 2023
  * Developed [honors thesis](/files/HonorsThesis.pdf) on Descartes quadruples of Apollonian circle packings
  * Advisors: Professor <a href="https://math.katestange.net">Kate Stange</a> and Professor <a href="https://math.colorado.edu/~jari2770">James Rickards</a>

* CU Boulder REU - Apollonian Circle Packings, Summer 2023
  * Disproved the Local-Global Conjecture for Apollonian Circle Packings
  * <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02749">Preprint</a> led to an article in <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/two-students-unravel-a-widely-believed-math-conjecture-20230810/">Quanta Magazine}
  * Advisors: Professor <a href="https://math.katestange.net">Kate Stange</a> and Professor <a href="https://math.colorado.edu/~jari2770">James Rickards</a>

* Honors Independent Study - Elliptic Curves, Spring 2023
  * Reading course over _Rational Points on Elliptic Curves_, Silverman \& Tate
  * Advisor: Professor <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/math/david-grant">David Grant</a>
  
* <a href="https://numberscope.colorado.edu">Numberscope</a> - Research Assistant & Developer, Fall 2022
  * Programmed visualizer that represents Collatz length of the values of a user-selected sequence from the OEIS using a scaled color gradient and a modular-controlled array.
  * Developed the Numberscope website to provide and improve user experience.
  * A [collage](/files/CollatzHD.jpg) I made using screenshots of my visualizer won the 2023 CU Arts & Sciences art contest!
  * Supervisor: Professor Stange

* Independent Study - Quadratic Reciprocity, Fall 2021
  * Reading course over _An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers_, Niven, Zuckerman, & Montgomery
  * Final Presentation [talk](/files/PresentationQuadraticReciprocity.pdf)
  * Advisor: Professor Paul Hagelstein
