## Research Experience
* Gallery of Theorems, Spring 2024
  * Aim: Represent mathematics concepts using artistic mediums
  * Further developed Numberscope visualizer to increase functionality
  * Advisor: Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sarahpetersen/home">Sarah Peterson</a>
  
* Fall 2022: Research Assistant & Developer, <a href="https://numberscope.colorado.edu">Numberscope</a> <div style="text-align: right"> your-text-here </div>
  * Programmed visualizer that represents Collatz length of the values of a user-selected sequence from the OEIS using a scaled color gradient and a modular-controlled array.
  * Developed the Numberscope website to provide and improve user experience.
  * A [collage](/files/CollatzHD.jpg) I made using screenshots of my visualizer won the 2023 CU Arts & Sciences art contest!
  * Supervisor: Professor Stange
