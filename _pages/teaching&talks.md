## Teaching

* September 1. 2023: I gave a 50-minute class lecture for MATH 2135 (Linear Algebra) over solutions to linear systems & vectors, Professor <a href="https://math.colorado.edu/~rmg/">Richard Green</a>. 
### High School
* Aug 2019 - May 2021: I taught weekly lessons in the Number Theory Club that I started at Fairview High School. Somehow <a href="https://fah.bvsd.org/clubs-activities/number-theory-club">this link</a> is still active!
