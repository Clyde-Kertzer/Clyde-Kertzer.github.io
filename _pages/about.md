Hello! My name is Clyde Kertzer and I am a 3rd-year undergraduate studying mathematics at University of Colorado Boulder. 
I especially enjoy number theory, cryptography and cybersecurity.

## Other Interests

When I'm not doing math, I'm probably playing soccer or hockey, watching the USMNT, or playing the trombone!
