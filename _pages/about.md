Hello! My name is Clyde Kertzer and I am a junior studying mathematics at University of Colorado, Boulder. I hope to go to grad school for number theory, but I also enjoy representation theory, and character theory!

My honors thesis,href="https://math.colorado.edu/~jari2770">_Parameterizations of Descartes Quadruples_</a>  was advised by <a href="https://math.katestange.net">Kate Stange</a> and <a href="https://math.colorado.edu/~jari2770">James Rickards</a>.

## Other Interests

When I'm not doing math, I'm probably playing soccer or hockey, watching the USMNT, or playing the trombone!
