Hello! My name is Clyde Kertzer and I am a senior studying mathematics at University of Colorado, Boulder. I hope to go to grad school for number theory, but I also enjoy representation theory and character theory! I am tutor for <a href="https://prepacademytutors.com/location/boulder/?tutor=clyde-k">Prep Academy</a>.

My honors thesis, [_Parameterizations of Descartes Quadruples_](/files/HonorsThesis.pdf) was advised by Professor <a href="https://math.katestange.net">Kate Stange</a> and Professor <a href="https://math.colorado.edu/~jari2770">James Rickards</a>.

## Other Interests

When I'm not doing math, I'm probably playing soccer or hockey, watching the USMNT, or playing the trombone!
