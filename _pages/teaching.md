Hello! My name is Clyde Kertzer and I am a 3rd-year undergraduate studying math at University of Colorado Boulder. 
I plan on pursuing number theory in graduate school.

---

I am currently researching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket">Apollonian circle packings</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://math.katestange.net">Kate Stange</a> and <a href="https://math.colorado.edu/~jari2770">James Rickards</a>. <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/math/david-grant">David Grant</a> is advising my undergraduate honors thesis on Elliptic Curves. 

## Other Interests

When I'm not doing math, I'm probably playing soccer or hockey, watching the USMNT, or playing the trombone!
